# Day 2: Timing Libraries, Synthesis Approaches, and Efficient Flip-Flop Coding
## Timing Libraries

### SKY130 PDK Overview

The SKY130 PDK is an open-source Process Design Kit based on SkyWater Technology's 130nm CMOS technology. It provides essential models and libraries for integrated circuit (IC) design, including timing, power, and process variation information.

### Decoding tt_025C_1v80 in the SKY130 PDK

- **tt**: Typical process corner.
- **025C**: Represents a temperature of 25°C, relevant for temperature-dependent performance.
- **1v80**: Indicates a core voltage of 1.8V.

This naming convention clarifies which process, voltage, and temperature conditions the library models.

### Opening and Exploring the .lib File

To open the sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib file:

1. **Install a text editor:**
   ```shell
   sudo apt install vim-gtk3
   ```
2. **Open the file:**
   ```shell
   gvim sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
   ```

### Hierarchical Synthesis

- **Definition**: Retains the module hierarchy as defined in RTL, synthesizing modules separately.
- **How it Works**: Tools like Yosys process each module independently, using commands such as `hierarchy` to analyze and set up the design structure.

**Advantages:**
- Faster synthesis time for large designs.
- Improved debugging and analysis due to maintained module boundaries.
- Modular approach, aiding integration with other tools.

**Disadvantages:**
- Cross-module optimizations are limited.
- Reporting can require additional configuration.

### Flattened Synthesis

- **Definition**: Merges all modules into a single flat netlist, eliminating hierarchy.
- **How it Works**: The `flatten` command in Yosys collapses the hierarchy, allowing whole-design optimizations.

**Advantages:**
- Enables aggressive, cross-module optimizations.
- Results in a unified netlist, sometimes simplifying downstream processes.

**Disadvantages:**
- Longer runtime for large designs.
- Loss of hierarchy complicates debugging and reporting.
- Can increase memory usage and netlist complexity.

**Example:**
<img width="1303" height="181" alt="synthezied_multi_moduls_flat" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e0ea4a7-e7de-4bc6-a1c2-da93c2540ac8" />

> **Important:** Hierarchical synthesis maintains sub-modules in the design, while flattening produces a netlist from the ground up.

### Key Differences

| Aspect                | Hierarchical Synthesis             | Flattened Synthesis           |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Hierarchy             | Preserved                          | Collapsed                    |
| Optimization Scope    | Module-level only                  | Whole-design                 |
| Runtime               | Faster for large designs           | Slower for large designs     |
| Debugging             | Easier (traces to RTL)             | Harder                       |
| Output Complexity     | Modular structure                  | Single, complex netlist      |
| Use Case              | Modularity, analysis, reporting    | Maximum optimization         |

## Flip-Flop Coding Styles

Flip-flops are fundamental sequential elements in digital design, used to store binary data. Below are efficient coding styles for different reset/set behaviors.

### Asynchronous Reset D Flip-Flop

```verilog
module dff_asyncres (input clk, input async_reset, input d, output reg q);
  always @ (posedge clk, posedge async_reset)
    if (async_reset)
      q <= 1'b0;
    else
      q <= d;
endmodule
```
- **Asynchronous reset**: Overrides clock, setting q to 0 immediately.
- **Edge-triggered**: Captures d on rising clock edge if reset is low.

### Asynchronous Set D Flip-Flop

```verilog
module dff_async_set (input clk, input async_set, input d, output reg q);
  always @ (posedge clk, posedge async_set)
    if (async_set)
      q <= 1'b1;
    else
      q <= d;
endmodule
```
- **Asynchronous set**: Overrides clock, setting q to 1 immediately.

### Synchronous Reset D Flip-Flop

```verilog
module dff_syncres (input clk, input async_reset, input sync_reset, input d, output reg q);
  always @ (posedge clk)
    if (sync_reset)
      q <= 1'b0;
    else
      q <= d;
endmodule
```
- **Synchronous reset**: Takes effect only on the clock edge.
